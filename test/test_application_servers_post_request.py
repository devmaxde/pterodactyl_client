    Welcome to the Pterodactyl v1 API documentation. This documentation is unofficial and provided by Dashflo.  If you find any errors throughout this API reference, please [let us know](https://dashflo.net/tickets/new). A special thanks to everyone who has helped contribute!  **The legacy Pterodactyl v0.7 API documentation [can be found here](https://dashflo.net/docs/api/pterodactyl/v0.7/).** Please remember you should not be using v0.7, and should upgrade as soon as possible.

Here is an example CURL request:  ``` curl \"<endpoint>\"   -H \"Authorization: Bearer <API-Key>\"   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\   -H \"Accept: Application/vnd.pterodactyl.v1+json\" \\ ```  # Ratelimits 240 requests can be made each minute. Headers are returned to show thelimit, and how many are used within minute. ``` x-ratelimit-limit: 240 x-ratelimit-remaining: 237 ```  # Docs Guide Some API routes require data input, or have additional information that can be provided. The route will include table(s) with the available parameters.   | Name                 | Description       | |----------------------|-------------------| | Include parameters   | List of parameters that can be used after adding `?include=<parameters>,<more-parameters>` to the route | | Available parameters | List of all the different parameters available such as `?example=something&example2=something` | | Filters | Filter the data to only include certain information `?filter[uuid]=something` | | Sort by | Sort the returned results `?sort=-id`. Add a `-` before the sort type to reverse the order | | Fields               | Data input fields |  You can combine multiple filters, it'll look for all matching results. For example, you could add &filter[uuid]=3387 and then it'll only return test@example.com.  ** ** [![Dashflo](https://cdn.dashflo.net/promotions/banners/service/minecraft/7u54t2qnuu8qTRv4.png?cache300620192021 =100%x100% \"Dashflo\")](https://dashflo.net/store/dedicated-servers)  # noqa: E501
